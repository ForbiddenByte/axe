# Automation eXecution Engine

A Way To Connect Neural Networks With Other Systems & Define Automations With A Graphical User Interface.

### About

Kinda like a game engine but instead of defining games you define electrical & mechanical systems. Uses MuJoCo as the physics engine, my own framework for neural networks, you can define everything via the graphical user interface and it's very configurable so new features can be added easily.


### TODO

A lot but it's functional enough..

Working on making it into an Android App. The Desktop version is more or less ready I'll try to finish the Android App this week if not I'll just post the desktop version.


### DEMO

Uses a 2D self-learning agent / neural network for control in a 3D enviroment.
