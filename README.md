# Automation eXecution Engine

A Way To Connect Neural Networks With Other Systems & Define Automations With A Graphical User Interface.

### About

Define enviroments with .xml files & entire simulations either manually with the GUI ( Graphical User Interface ) or by assigning A.I. systems to objects. 

Easily flash the entire simulation on to hardware later.

Kinda like a game engine but instead of defining games you define electrical & mechanical systems. Uses MuJoCo as the physics engine, my own framework for neural networks, you can define everything via the graphical user interface and it's very configurable so new features can be added easily.

### TODO

A lot but it's functional enough..

( WebApp as well could be run on a University to give everyone access although I'm having a hard time compiling the ML frameworks to .wasm so unless alot of additional work is done, it would be limited to manually defining things in the GUI )
